# DW-FWI
Dongwoo's FWI code

This repository aims to implement Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) tailored for near-surface geophysical problems. The inversion framework is developed in PyTorch, leveraging [Deepwave](https://github.com/ar4/deepwave) for elastic wave simulation and using the Adam optimizer for model updates.
